h2. ABOUT:

Inploy is a Rails plugin to deploy applications in a easier way. You can use Inploy from a remote machine or from the local machine, too. It's integrated with Git, Subversion, Rake and intended to do most of the common work, so you don't need to.

Actually, Inploy has four rake tasks:

* inploy:remote:setup

- connects to a list of servers
- clones a repository
- runs inploy:local:setup

* inploy:remote:update

- connects to a list of servers
- runs inploy:local:update

* inploy:local:setup

- copies config/*.sample files to config/*
- creates directory tmp/pids
- executes init.sh file case it exists
- installs gems
- migrates the database for the production environment
- cleans the cache in public/cache
- parses less files if more:parse tasks exists
- package the assets if asset:packager:build_all task exists
- touch tmp/restart.txt

* inploy:local:update

- pulls the repository
- installs gems
- migrates the database for the production environment
- cleans the cache in public/cache
- parses less files if more:parse tasks exists
- package the assets if asset:packager:build_all task exists
- touch tmp/restart.txt
